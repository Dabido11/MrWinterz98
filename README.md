# About Me
👋 Hey there, I'm Winter, otherwise known as MrWinterz98!

🎈 I'm interested in coding for primarily Python.

🐍 I'm currently learning Python, Java and SQL.

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on Github and Discord.

📮 Reach me through my socials and find my carrd [here](https://winter78.carrd.co/).

💻 My primary code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), followed by [Replit](https://replit.com/) (which is technically an IDE).

🐱‍💻 I use GitHub for collaborating with my team or storing essential backups of my code.
